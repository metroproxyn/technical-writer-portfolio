# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you make your first API request in under 5 minutes. Follow these steps to set up your environment, authenticate, and manage your first task.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A command-line tool (like curl) or an API client (like Postman or Insomnia).
- Your API key from the [Developer Dashboard](https://app.taskmanager.com/developers). *(Example link)*

## Step 1: Authenticate a Request

Let's start by fetching your user profile. This verifies your API key is working correctly.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.taskmanager.com/v1/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**Response:**

```
json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 12345,
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "timezone": "UTC"
  }
}
```

>**Success:** If you see a response similar to this, your authentication is working! If you get an error, double-check your API key.

## Step 2: Create Your First Task

Now, let's create a new task using the /tasks endpoint.

**Request:**

```bash

```

**Response:**

```json

```

>**Note:** Save the `id` returned in the response (e.g., `67890`). You'll need it for the next steps.

## Step 3: Retrieve Your Tasks

**Request:**

```bash

```

**Response:**

```json

```

## Step 4: Update the Task

**Request:**

```bash

```

**Response:**

```json

```

## Step 5: Filter Tasks (Optional)

**Request:**

```bash

```

**Response:**

```json

```
