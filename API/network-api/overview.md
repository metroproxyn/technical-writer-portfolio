# Network API Documentation

Welcome to the Network API documentation portal. This project demonstrates a set of powerful, developer-friendly APIs based on the **GSMA Open Gateway (CAMARA)** standard.

These APIs abstract the complexity of global telecommunications networks, allowing developers to embed security, verification, and quality-of-service features directly into their applications.
