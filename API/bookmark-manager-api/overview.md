The Bookmark Manager API provides a robust interface for creating, managing, and retrieving web bookmarks. It supports user authentication, tagging, and full CRUD operations.

## Core Concepts

*   **Base URL:** `https://api.bookmarkmanager.com/v1`
*   **Authentication:** Bearer Token (JWT)
*   **Data Format:** JSON
*   **Rate Limiting:** 100 requests per minute per API key

## Quick Start

1.  **Get your API Key:** Sign up for a developer account to obtain your `API_KEY`.
2.  **Authenticate:** Include the key in the `Authorization` header of your requests.
3.  **Make your first request:** Retrieve your profile information.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.bookmarkmanager.com/v1/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
