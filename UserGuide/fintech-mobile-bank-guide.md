# How to Send Money to a Friend Using Online Banking

> This example was created as part of a study of best practices in documentation for the fintech sector. The goal is to create a clear guide for end users who are unfamiliar with the mobile banking interface. The focus is on clarity and step-by-step instructions.

Follow these steps to send money to a friend through your bank's mobile app or website.

## What You'll Need

*   Access to your online banking (username and password).
*   A stable internet connection.
*   The recipient's details: phone number, card number, or account information.
*   Sufficient funds in your account and available transfer limit.

> **IMPORTANT:** Never share one-time passcodes (OTP/SMS codes) or passwords with anyone. Your bank will never ask for them via messaging apps or phone calls. Always use your bank's official website or app; never enter banking details on third-party sites.

## Choose a Transfer Method

*   **By phone number:** Fast and convenient, if your friend's bank supports it.
*   **By card number:** A reliable alternative if a phone transfer isn't available.
*   **By account details:** Typically used for interbank or international transfers.

## Steps to Transfer Money

1.  **Sign in to online banking.**
    Open your bank's official app or website and log in to your account. Confirm your identity using biometrics or a one-time code if prompted.

    Carefully check all information: the transfer method, recipient details, amount, currency, and any applicable fees.

> **NOTE:** Processing times and fees depend on the recipient's bank, the transfer method, and the currency. Transfers to accounts in other banks may incur a fee and take several business days, while transfers via Faster Payments (FPS) are usually instant.

## What's Next

*   Save the recipient to your contacts for faster transfers in the future.
*   Create a transfer template for recurring payments.
*   Set up payment reminders for regular transactions.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No SMS code received** | Check your mobile network signal and disable "Do Not Disturb" mode. Request a new code after 30-60 seconds. |
| **Transfer limit exceeded** | Reduce the transfer amount or increase your transfer limit in your security settings. |
| **Recipient name doesn't match** | Double-check the provided details. If in doubt, contact your friend to confirm their information. |
| **Transfer status is "In progress"** | Check the status in **History**. If it remains unchanged for an unusually long time, contact your bank's support and provide the transaction ID. |
