# Technical Writing Portfolio

Technical Writer and Documentation Engineer with over 5 years of experience in end-to-end documentation for B2B SaaS and AI-driven products. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex engineering concepts and end-users by creating clear, user-centric content that improves product adoption and reduces support load.

My expertise lies in modern docs-as-code ecosystems and API documentation, supported by a hands-on background in Machine Learning. This unique combination allows me to deeply understand technical systems and contribute effectively to developer workflows.
